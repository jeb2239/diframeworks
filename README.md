# Golang Dependency Injection Frameworks

This repo has very simple examples of how to use both fx and wire di frameworks.

The uber fx framework uses reflection to initialize dependencies where as wire uses a code generator.

Ideally would like to add some examples using fx lifecycle and advanced features
along with wire provider sets and other stuff.
